# üè† Homelab

## Introduction

This repo contains the configuration and documentation for my homelab. 

I started this project primarily to have a place to try new things and learn new skills. I continue to find that the process of self-hosting applications quickly exposes you to areas that you're rusty or unfamiliar with and is in my mind the most effective way to learn.

## Hardware

### Nodes

I currently run my Homelab by way of a Raspberry Pi running the Raspberry Pi OS Lite. I am using a C4 Labs cluster case and a Raspberry Pi 5 8GB with a PoE+ hat. Later, I plan to expand this to a multi-node cluster and swapping the OS to Talos to make provisioning clusters easier.


### Storage

For the time being I have a 2TB SSD directly attached to the primary node of the cluster. Ideally I would like to get a proper NAS setup, but in the meantime may look to set up unRAID instead.
